# Football-Simulator-Python
When playing, the user will be prompted to make a move through menus that pop up depending on the play they want to make. If they run, the program will simply return the stats of the run and will bring the offensive menu up again. If the player chooses to throw a short pass, they can pick the distance they are looking to throw. The same goes when the user picks a long distance throw. Lastly, the user can pick to kick which is much easier to do in close range of the touchdown. It is important to note that the program keeps in mind the amount of yardage and downs. If the user does not get the first down within the 4 down limit, they lose. The goal is to get 7 points: a touchdown (6 points) and score the field goal (1 point). The offensive simulation only allows for a single offensive touchdown attempt meaning if the user gets a touchdown and scores the field goal, the simulation ends. It also means that if the user does not score any points at all, the simulation still ends. Make sure to give it a shot for yourself to see how you like it. I warn you, its quite addicting!
